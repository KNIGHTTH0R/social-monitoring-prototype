This tool is a prototype of a social media monitoring tool. It was developed to check if its possible to build a monitoring tool based on piwik.

Therefore the tool consists of 2 modules:
 1. A Fetcher for collecting data from social media accounts 
 2. A Piwik plugin that accesses the collected data and displays it 

A simple database concept was created to store the metrics information.
Maybe an installation guide will follow, to explain how to setup the tool.
